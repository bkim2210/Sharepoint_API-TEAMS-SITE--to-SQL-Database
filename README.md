Import Libraries:

The script begins by importing necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, datetime for working with dates and times, sys for handling command-line arguments, pyodbc for connecting to SQL Server, sqlalchemy for SQL interaction, and various libraries from the office365 package for working with Microsoft Graph API and SharePoint.
Parse Command Line Arguments:

The script attempts to parse command-line arguments. If the required arguments are not provided, default values are used.
Connect to Data Warehouse:

It determines the available drivers for pyodbc and establishes a connection to the data warehouse using SQLAlchemy.
Get Microsoft Graph Access Token:

The script uses client credentials flow to obtain an access token from Microsoft Graph API for authentication.
Retrieve SharePoint Site Information:

It retrieves information about the SharePoint site associated with the specified Teams group.
Retrieve Worksheets Information:

The script fetches information about the worksheets within the specified Excel file in SharePoint.
Extract Data from "Master Product List" Worksheet:

It extracts data from the "Master Product List" worksheet, excluding the first row, and stores it in a pandas DataFrame.
Insert Data into SQL Table:

The script attempts to insert the data from the DataFrame into a specified SQL table using the to_sql method. If an error occurs, it logs the error and raises an exception.
Error Logging Function:

There's a function errorLog defined earlier in the script for logging errors to an error table in the database.
Replace Placeholder Comments:

Note: Replace the placeholder comments like "Enter Your Database Name", "Enter Tenant Id", etc., with your actual values before using the script.
To use this script, you should have the necessary access permissions to the data warehouse, Microsoft Graph API, and SharePoint, and you need to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and identifiers. Also, ensure that the required Python packages are installed.
